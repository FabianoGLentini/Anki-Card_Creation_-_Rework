**Anki Card Creation & Rework** is a custom GPT assistant designed to generate modular, responsive, and well-formatted Anki flashcards using clean, Anki-compatible HTML syntax. It follows best practices for flashcard design to optimize learning outcomes when using active recall and spaced repetition.

The assistant adapts to various subjects ‚Äî including:

- **Mathematics**: Uses LaTeX for equations and formulas
- **Programming**: Outputs styled code with colors inspired by Visual Studio Code
- **Conceptual Subjects**: Handles summaries, structured notes, and terminology with clear semantic formatting

This assistant was built through hands-on prompt engineering and instructional design using:

- **Meta Prompting**: High-level prompts guiding the assistant's behavior and structure
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Example-based calibration to establish output consistency
- **Instruction Fine-Tuning**: Iterative tuning of format rules, wording, and visual styling
- **HTML/CSS Design**: Custom-designed templates built with direct HTML/CSS knowledge for Anki compatibility
